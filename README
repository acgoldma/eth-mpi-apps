Eth MPI apps
------------

* To build the RPM and SRPM:

  1. mkdir -p $HOME/rpmbuild/{SOURCES,RPMS,SRPMS}
  2. tar czf $HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES/eth-mpi-apps.tgz --exclude-vcs .
  3. rpmbuild -ba ./OpenIb_Host/mpi-apps.spec

  This will build the eth-mpi-apps RPMs in $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/(architecture)/

  This will also create a eth-mpi-apps-debuginfo RPM, which by default contains basic symbol
  information - see below on how to build with full debugging information.


* How to include debugging symbols:

  export BUILD_CONFIG=debug

  prior to either of the aforementioned build procedures.
